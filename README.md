# Packsy

Packsy is a declarative package sync tool for Arch-based systems.
It installs packages from a list and optionally removes those not listedâ€”keeping your system clean, minimal, and reproducible. Ideal for maintaining consistent setups across machines.

## WIP

This project is mainly for personal use and for me to learn rust. You're free to help me out, but like I said it's mostly for educational purposes.
