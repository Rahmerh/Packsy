Packsy is a declarative **pack**age **sy**nc tool for Arch-based systems.
It installs packages from a list and optionally removes those not listedâ€”keeping your system clean, minimal, and reproducible. Ideal for maintaining consistent setups across machines.

## Usage

Coming soon...

## Disclaimer

It's not likely anyone reads this, but in case you do, this project is mostly for me to learn rust. I wanted to try and build my own CLI tool and seemed like this could be a cool idea. I realize there are other, probably better, tools out there to manage your packages, but only way to learn is to do

If you want to help, feel free! But if you don't mind, please explain your changes if you want to contribute. That's just so I can learn from your PRs! If you don't want to, that's also okay.
